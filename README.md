# IN6227 Data Mining: Assignment 2 - Association Rule Mining Model Comparison

**Course**: IN6227 Data Mining

**\nAssignment**: Assignment 2 - Association Rule Mining Model Comparison

***

## Project Overview

This project implements and compares two fundamental algorithms for **Association Rule Mining (ARM)**—the **Apriori algorithm** and a custom **Brute-Force approach**—using a large market basket dataset.

The primary objective is to analyze the performance (execution time) and output (number of rules generated) of these two models across varying sample sizes to study their **scalability** and **computational efficiency** in a real-world data mining scenario. The final strong rules identified by the Apriori algorithm are used to formulate actionable business recommendations.
